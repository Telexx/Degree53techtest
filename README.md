tech test for degree53

Completed test as best I could with the time available to me (extremely busy @ work). I did not have time to spend ages on a UI or to impliment the favorites feature.

I used Alamofire as a cocoapod for networking.

I have used a webview to display the readme files as was required, it said not to use 3rd party applications so this was the best way I could think of without using a 3rd party markdown display engine.
